Place brand image files here for public serving.

To use the provided Ram Setu logo image:
1) Save the attached logo as `ramsetu-logo.png` in this folder (DBMS/ramsetu-health-bridge-main/public/ramsetu-logo.png).
2) The app will automatically use `/ramsetu-logo.png` in the header and footer.
3) If the PNG is missing, the UI falls back to the bundled SVG at `src/assets/ramsetu-logo.svg`.

Recommended: 512x512 PNG with transparent background for crisp display on dark and light themes.
