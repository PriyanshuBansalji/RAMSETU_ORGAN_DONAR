Place your awareness video here as `awareness.mp4` (or another filename) and set
`VITE_DONOR_VIDEO_URL` accordingly in the frontend `.env` file.

Examples:
- VITE_DONOR_VIDEO_URL=/videos/awareness.mp4
- VITE_DONOR_VIDEO_URL=/videos/my-video.mp4

Note: This folder is served statically by Vite/production builds. Keep files reasonably small for faster loads.
